An IRC bot that assists with URLs and descriptions of JIRA issues in #dspace and #duraspace IRC channels.


## Installation

2) Edit ~/.kompewter/default.py to have your bot nickname, set your channel, and server

## To Run

3) Run ./kompewter - this now runs kompewter with your settings

(Note, since this is a fork of bot called jenni, there are probably many places in the code that refer to jenni).
